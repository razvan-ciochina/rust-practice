[mandelbrot](./mandelbrot) - This is Listing 2.12 from "Rust in action" which had some problems which needed to be fixed


A list of things that you should be able to answer after studying the language:

 1. What is a `Box`, `Rc`, and `Arc` ?
 2. What is the difference between `&`, `&mut`, `ref` and `ref mut`?
 3. What is the unit type?
 4. What is destructuring (not deconstruction!) and show to match variables work?
 5. What is a move block/closure/capture?
 6. What is a higher order function?
 7. What does `_` do in Rust?
 8. What is an attribute?
 9. What is a trait and how do you implement/use it?
10. What is a diverging function?
11. What is an option type, how do you create it with `Some` and `None`, and how to you unpack it with `?` ?
12. How do you `map` and `and_then` with options?
13. How do you convert `Option<Option<T>>` to `Option<T>`?
14. How do you create a list with `enum`s?
15. How many references of each type (`&mut` or `&`) can you hold and when do they prohibit each other?
